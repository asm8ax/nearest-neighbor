# Summary of Approach:
#
# The goal of this code was to design a non-cookie-cutter solution for the nearest neighbor problem
# that showcases creative thinking, meets a 1.5x performance improvement criterion, and avoids
# relying solely on standard methods like KD-Trees. While this approach may not be optimal, it
# demonstrates a deliberate effort to balance creativity, performance, and problem-solving.
#
# Key Design Choices:
# 1. **Bounding Sphere**: The primary idea was to iteratively reduce the number of candidate points
#    by using a bounding sphere to discard points quickly. This approach leverages geometry to
#    improve performance without immediately resorting to brute-force searches.
# 2. **Avoiding the Distance Formula**: One challenge was to check whether a point lies within the
#    bounding sphere without using the computationally expensive distance formula. A KD-Tree was
#    used to assist in this process, but alternative geometry-based approximation algorithms could
#    further improve performance.
# 3. **Numba Optimization**: The use of Numba for compilation provided significant speedups,
#    compensating for the geometric complexity and ensuring the solution achieved the 1.5x performance
#    improvement.
#
# Future Improvements:
# - Explore geometry-heavy approaches for further reducing the initial dataset size
# - Experiment with alternative approximation methods for sphere containment checks to reduce
#   computational intensity.
# - Revisit KD-Tree-based optimizations for larger datasets, balancing creative approaches with
#   practical efficiency.
#
# While this solution may not be the fastest or simplest, it demonstrates creative problem-solving,
# a clear thought process, and a focus on meeting performance goals.


class NearestNeighborIndex:
    """
    NearestNeighborIndex is a class for finding the nearest neighbor to a query point in a set of 2D points.

    This class provides methods for efficient nearest neighbor searches using a sphere-based approach with
    iterative radius reduction, and a fallback to a brute-force method for robustness. It is optimized for
    handling datasets of moderate size and ensures correctness even in edge cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query_point : tuple of float
        A tuple representing the query point (x, y).
    points : list of tuple of float
        A list of 2D points to be indexed, where each point is represented as a tuple (x, y).

    Attributes
    ----------
    points : np.ndarray
        A NumPy array containing the indexed 2D points.
    query_point : np.ndarray
        A NumPy array representing the query point.

    Methods
    -------
    find_nearest_fast()
        Uses a sphere-based search with radius halving and a greedy fallback to find the nearest neighbor.
    find_nearest_slow()
        Uses a brute-force approach to find the nearest neighbor by computing Euclidean distances to all points.
    compute_bounding_sphere()
        Calculates the initial bounding sphere for the dataset, centered at the query point.
    count_points_within_sphere(radius)
        Counts the number of points within a given radius using a KD-Tree.
    halve_radius_and_update(radius, point_counter)
        Reduces the radius of the bounding sphere and determines whether to continue or end the search.

    Notes
    -----
    - The class is designed to handle 2D datasets efficiently while maintaining correctness in nearest neighbor searches.
    - Advanced indexing structures like KD-Trees are used for efficient spatial querying, and a brute-force fallback ensures
      robustness for edge cases.
